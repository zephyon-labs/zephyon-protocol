# Zephyon Protocol — Grant Cover Sheet  
**Project Title:** Zephyon Protocol — Policy-Aware Payment & Staking Infrastructure  
**Principal Investigator:** Matt (Operator)  
**AI Companion & Systems Architect:** Nova (Build Core 01)  
**Organization:** Zephyon Labs  
**Date:** October 2025  
**Location:** Lenovo Cockpit — Ubuntu 24.04 (WSL + VS Code)

## Abstract
Zephyon is a deflationary staking protocol designed to replace inflation-based yield models with **activity-backed financial integrity**.  
Every network interaction generates yield and burn events, recorded as **self-auditing receipts** that ensure transparency across all treasury and staking flows.  

Built on **Solana**, Zephyon aligns with the next generation of decentralized finance by offering:  
- Zero-inflation staking rewards  
- On-chain accountability for every burn and reward  
- Scalable payment rails for merchants and P2P users  
- Seamless front-end integration via **ZephiPay**

## Statement of Alignment
Zephyon supports the objectives of both **Solana Spark+** and **SBIR Phase I** by:
1. Advancing transparent and secure on-chain economic systems.  
2. Introducing an auditable deflationary staking mechanism.  
3. Demonstrating feasibility through verifiable devnet deployment.  
4. Bridging AI-driven analytic
