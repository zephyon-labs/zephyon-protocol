# Zephyon Protocol — Grant Brief
# Zephyon Grant Brief  
**Linked Project:** Zephyon Protocol  
**Category:** Policy-Aware Payment & Staking Infrastructure  
**Repository:** `/dev/zephyon/zephyon-protocol`

## Executive Linkage
This brief summarizes Zephyon’s high-level proposal across all active grant phases, including Solana Spark+ and SBIR Phase I.

Zephyon operates as a **deflationary staking protocol** built on Solana, designed to convert every network transaction into transparent yield and burn events.  
Each grant stage directly contributes to public financial integrity, security, and accessibility within Web3 payment systems.

- [tokenomics.md](../tokenomics.md) — ZERA supply & mechanics  
- [deployment.md](../deployment.md) — build & proof of execution  


## 1. Overview
Short paragraph (4–6 sentences) describing Zephyon’s purpose:
- Peer-to-peer and merchant payments.
- Deflationary staking + immutable receipts.
- Built entirely on Solana with Anchor.
- Mission: “Complexity on the inside, clarity on the outside.”

## 2. Problem
Describe the friction in current crypto payments:
- Slow settlement.
- High fees.
- No transparent tax trail.
- Disconnected staking / yield systems.

## 3. Solution
Explain how Zephyon addresses each pain point:
- Adaptive staking with deflationary burn.
- Receipt ledger for compliance and trust.
- Treasury routing + governance vaults.
- Simple UX: Send, Receive, Earn, Withdraw.

## 4. Technical Architecture
- Programs: fee_router, staking_vault, receipts, governor.
- Anchor version, Rust toolchain, Solana CLI version.
- Data flow diagram (insert link or image).
- Security: immutable receipts, account constraints, admin timelock.

## 5. Current Progress
- Environment verified on Lenovo (Rust 1.90, Anchor 0.32.1).
- Modules scaffolded and compiling.
- Devnet deployment pending.
- Docs: `/docs/design_ethos.md`, `/docs/decisions.md`.

## 6. Roadmap (Next 3–6 Months)
| Milestone | Target Date | Status |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| Router + Receipts MVP | Dec 2025 | In progress |
| Staking Vault Integration | Jan 2026 | Planned |
| Governance Stub | Feb 2026 | Planned |
| Testnet Pilot | Mar 2026 | Planned |

## 7. Ecosystem Impact
- Encourages real-world adoption of Solana Pay.
- Lowers barrier for merchants via human-readable receipts.
- Demonstrates hybrid treasury + staking architecture for future dApps.

## 8. Grant Request
Outline what you’re asking for (tooling, audit, marketing support).
- Requested: 15–25 K USDC equivalent in developer + audit funding.
- Intended Use: audit, security review, UX testing.
